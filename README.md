Watches a list of subreddits for images of a certain size and aspect ratio and saves them to disk.

To use this, you'll need to create a file called `auth_info.json` and fill it with the following information:

```json
{
    "client_id": "<Your App ID>",
    "client_secret": "<Your App Secret>",
}
```

You can get this information by creating an app at [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
