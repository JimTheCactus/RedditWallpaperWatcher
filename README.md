# RedditWallpaperWatcher
Watches a list of subreddits for images of a certain size and aspect ratio and saves them to disk.

To use this, you'll need to create a file called `auth_info.yaml` and fill it with the following information:

```yaml
---
client_id: "<Your Client Key Here>"
client_secret: "<Your Client Secret Here>"

```

You can get this information by creating an app at [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

Once that's done, you'll want to edit wallpaper_config.yaml to suit your tastes.
